# Nearbii

This project was create by myself and a group of students for the course SEG2900 at the University of Ottawa. Our task was to design and create a marketing website for a startup idea. Our idea was a proximity-based online meeting software that took into account the user's position amongst other users in a virtual environment to determine who the user could interact with. Our project was selected as a finalist in the pitch competition that took place at the end of the course.
